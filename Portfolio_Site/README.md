# Portfolio Site Work Example

### Intro

This website is a basic attempt to display my ability to create a 
working site. This entire site was created with notepad and a 
browsers inspect feature, not a text editor. Not that I like to 
create more work for myself but, to show that I am capable with 
limited resources to create a working site.

### Home Page

This page has several different features and animations. The first 
is the name for each of my fields of experience based on “curser hover.” This 
is followed by a click on each area that allows for overlay lists to 
appear with more details.

### About Page

This page has several different features and animations. The first 
are the two separate slide shows with previous and nest button. In 
addition to this there are selector buttons allowing for jumping 
from one picture to the next.

### Resume Page

This page has several different features and animations. This page
includes an ifram that changes from my resume to my cover letter. 
This is also containing a registration form to allow the download of 
these documents after registrations have completed.

### Projects Page

This page has a set of overviews and selectors for some of the other 
projects that I am working on.

            <h3>Professional Life</h3>
            <p>
              I graduated college in 2002 with bachelor's degrees in Analytical Chemistry and Structural Geology. 
              During my time at college, I was the chemistry department computer lab administrator, Geology club treasurer, 
              and a lab tech/intern at the BLM water resource lab in Alamosa, CO. Shortly after graduation I started my professional 
              career as an analytical chemist and a geologist performing analysis and characterizations. This allowed for a variety
              of experiences in both lab and field settings.
            </p>
            <p> 
              In the lab I was able to properly operate, calibrate and maintain a number of analytical instruments. 
              These devices include HPLC, GC-NMR, UV-Vis, XRF, and ISOX to name a few. This gave me a wide variety of 
              experiences allowing me to apply my academics in the real world. This lab work was in a variety of settings 
              from government and private production labs to working in R&D. This gave me an appreciation of accuracy and 
              consistency of technique and operational standards.
            </p>
            <p> 
              In the field I performed a number of tasks from sampling, core logging, and materials testing. To perform 
              these duties I used additional analytical equipment such as flow meters, pressure sensors, gas/air monitoring 
              equipment and other manual methods. Hammer drill and explosives was a highlight. These operations were mostly 
              in the mineral or construction side of the world of geology world. Here I learned that even tighter controls 
              needed to be adhered to prevent cross contamination so a good lab test could occur.
            </p>

            <p> 
              During this time, I learned a talent for instrumentation and programming on a variety of softwares and platforms. 
              I also applied my academic programming skills to create simple scripts and programs to make my day easier. This 
              inspired me to return to school in 2009 for engineering with an emphasis in electronics and instrumentation. After 
              graduation 2013 I began my career in Electrical Designer and Controls System Engineering world. This allowed me to 
              tie my instrumentation background into a new operational space.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this role I have designed, repaired, troubleshot, and retrofitted several types of control systems. These 
              systems can be found in the mineral extraction, water/waste-water, manufacturing and in various facets of oil 
              and gas. Some of these systems varied in complexity from standalone units to cellular WAN connected fields.
            </p>
            <p>
              As part of this I have worked with many different PLC ecosystems, mixed and unified, paired with both Windows 
              and Linux based environments. This variety of PLC hardware includes Allen-Bradly, Siemens, ABB, OPTO22 and a 
              variety of others manufactures. I have programmed these units in structured text, function block, and ladder 
              logic based on need, operation and user preference. To add to this I have created a number of AOI's and data 
              structures to allow simplification and reuse of code.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of these systems have had server based SCADA system overlays, simple HMI controls, regional DCS style 
              controls, and headless units that use a custom web based interfaces. This variety of HMI softwares include 
              FactoryTalk, S7, Ignition, ABB Graphics, and NodeRed to start the list. One such endeavor including a system 
              involving edge/IOT computing to allow the remote monitoring and operations while using the dependability of a 
              PLC to control an oil and gas well site, tank emission control systems (TEMS). This was performed in several 
              layers using a Java script head, Python and C++ inter device communications and structured text PLC code.

            <h3>Personal Life</h3>
            
            <p>
              I am a happily married man of 15+ years, with two wonderful children. I enjoy outdoor activities when I can. 
              My favorites are cycling, hiking, rock climbing and skiing in no real order. Although lately I have mostly 
              been doing projects with my kids and the home improvement gig as the schedule allows.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, I am still expanding my knowledge as a lifelong learner and what I would qualify as a functional 
              tinkerer. What I mean by functional is that I only have three or four projects at a given time cluttering 
              up space that I finish before attempting more. Not that my list is not growing, current count 35, just the 
              physical manifestation of that list. This is just to both manage my time and effort, and also prevent my 
              
              wife from cleaning house, me included. Currently I am learning 3d modeling software and how it works with 
              a CNC. This has led to basic machining and prototyping using a 3D printer and a lathe.

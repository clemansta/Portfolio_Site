      Attn:	Human Resources

      Hello Sir or Madam:
      <p>
        I am a computationally minded hands-on, mechanically and technically oriented person looking for a position 
        that will give me room to grow.  I have experience working in the instrumentation and controls, oil and gas, 
        and chemical regulatory industry. I am an analytical problem solver with a variety of skills learned from my 
        varied working history, and supported by bachelorâ€™s degrees in electronics engineering, chemistry and geology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am experienced with programming in Java, C, C++, RSLogix, ControlLogix, FactoryTalk view, PCCU, and 
        Ignition. I have experience in most electronic and physical testing methods, network setup, circuit design, 
        RF spectroscopy and fabrication techniques.   These skills are augmented by my ability to communicate and 
        understand the goal of any project that I am involved in.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to these technical skills, I am also skilled in most Microsoft computer software, AutoCAD, basic
        computer/electronics repair and construction.
      </p>
      <p>
        My references are available upon further inquiry. Check out my LinkedIn account for examples of my work at

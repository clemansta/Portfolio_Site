      <h3>Hello,</h3>
      <p>
        I am a computationally minded, mechanically and technically oriented person looking for a hands-on position that will give me room to grow.  I have experience working in a variety of industries, including oil and gas, water/waste water, chemical manufacturing, mineral extraction, analytical and governmental regulatory industry. I am an analytical problem solver with a variety of skills learned from my varied working history, and supported by bachelor's degrees in electronics engineering, chemistry and geology. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am experienced with programming in Python, Java, C, C++, JavaScript, RSLogix, FactoryTalk View, S7, 800xA, OPTO22 and Ignition. I have experience in most electronic and physical analytical testing methods, IT infrastructure and networking, circuit design, RF spectroscopy and basic fabrication techniques.   These skills are augmented by my ability to understand the goal and requirements of most any project that I am involved in. Often allowing me to act as a liaison between groups aiding communication and work flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the industry grows and changes, I am always happy to learn, grow and adapt. As almost every situation requires individual attention to meet the needs of clients, tried and true way, while a staple for a reason, sometimes need a new take to accomplish the goals. In addition to these technical skills, I am also skilled in most Microsoft computer software, AutoCAD, basic computer/electronics repair and construction.

      <b>Staff Applications Engineer: 4 years</b>
      
      <p>I have created several programs that utilize modern programming languages including. These commercially ready programs have specialized markets where they were designed to bridge industrial networks with considerable success. Most of these programs have been designed for limited resourse single board and IIOT devices for operations in the field. These systems were created utilizing communications for email and SMS alarming, data management and limited system control.</p>

      <b>Analytical and Environmental Chemist: 10 years</b>
      
      <p>In this previous life I successfully operated analytical instrumentation of many types. This lead me to become part of several clean-up operations and even Hazardous Waste Management. I specialized in chemical fingerprinting and EPA regulations. During this endeavor I learned how to install, operate, maintain, and manage analytical instruments. Manage a large quantity hazardous waste generator and a staff required to operate the facility. Eventually leading me to engineering of electronics, my own analyzers, and programming. </p>
